# PROJECT BY JOY AKINYI(NYC TAXI DATASET 2022 JANUARY)
## Introduction
A Project that uses Bokeh for visualisations and draws insights from them.This is a prerequisite to join the Outreachy internship program
> This dataset was downloaded from the following link
## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
From the BOKEH_Taxi.ipynb file i concluded the following




From the BOKEH_VIZ.ipynb file i had the following findings:
> 1.Effects of oversampling

Visual clutter: Overplotting can make a plot appear visually cluttered, making it difficult to read and interpret. This can also lead to user fatigue and make it harder to discern patterns and trends in the data.

Bias in analysis: Overplotting can also lead to biased analysis, particularly if certain regions of the plot are more densely populated than others. This can result in overemphasis on certain areas of the data and underemphasis on others, leading to skewed conclusions.

2.Effects of Undersampling

Loss of information: Undersampling can result in a loss of information, particularly if important data points are excluded from the subset. This can result in incorrect conclusions being drawn from the data and can reduce the accuracy of models trained on the subset.
Overgeneralization: Undersampling can also result in overgeneralization, particularly if the subset is not representative of the population as a whole. This can result in inaccurate models that do not capture the true complexity of the data
Using Alpha
Alpha refers to the level of transparency or opacity of graphical elements, such as points or lines, used to represent data. Alpha is typically represented by a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely transparent (invisible) and 1 is completely opaque.

The above effects can be solved by using alpha as it improves data visibility by reducing overplotting and allowing users to see the individual data points more clearly. This can help users identify patterns and trends in the data that may have been obscured by overplotting.

Using alpha also enhances effective communication since it helps in the communication of data by making it easier for users to understand the data being presented. This can help users better communicate their findings to others and improve the overall effectiveness of data-driven decision-making.
